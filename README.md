In the top right corner of the osTicket interface, you'll find options to switch between the Admin Panel and Agent Panel. Simply click on the displayed panel name, either “Admin Panel” or “Agent Panel”, to switch between them. If you see “Agent Panel”, it indicates that you're currently accessing osTicket as an administrator. Conversely, if “Admin Panel” is displayed, you're in the Agent Panel interface. Each panel offers distinct functionalities tailored to administrative tasks and agent operations.
